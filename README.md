Tavenem.Chemistry
==

Tavenem.Chemistry provides an assortment of structs and classes which facilitate modeling chemical
formulae and physical substances.

## Installation

Tavenem.Chemistry is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tavenem.Chemistry/).

## Roadmap

Tavenem.Chemistry is currently in a **prerelease** state. Development is ongoing, and breaking
changes are possible before the first production release.

No release date is currently set for v1.0 of Tavenem.Chemistry. The project is currently in a "wait
and see" phase while [Tavenem.DataStore](https://github.com/Tavenem/DataStore) (a dependency of
Tavenem.Chemistry) is in prerelease. When that project has a stable release, a production release of
Tavenem.Chemistry will follow.
